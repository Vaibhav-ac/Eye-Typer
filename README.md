# Eye-Typing
FOR C++ :<br>
Using OpenCV in C++ the code detects face and eyes using a haar cascade classifier. The coordinates of the midpoints of the eye are used to move the cursor on the screen. A keyboard interface is placed on the screen on which the cursor can move to select the desired letter. If the cursor is present on a letter for some seconds then the letter is printed on the screen.<br>

FOR PYTHON :<br>
Using Mediapipe, Opencv, Tkinter, Numpy and Pyautogui created a program that detects the movement of eyes and face to move the cursor on the screen using the relative face motion. A keyboard interface is placed on the screen on which the cursor can move to select the desired letter. If the cursor is present on a letter for some seconds then the letter is printed on the screen.<br>


# Requirements
FOR C++ :<br>
To run this code, OpenCV should be installed with Haar cascades files present in the current directory where the code is being executed. Downloading and using OpenCV in C++ could be challenging, I would recommend using Visual Studio and following a guide to make OpenCV work properly for C++.<br> 

FOR PYTHON :<br>
pip install mediapipe <br>
pip install opencv-python <br>
pip install numpy <br>
pip install pyautogui <br>
pip install tk <br>
