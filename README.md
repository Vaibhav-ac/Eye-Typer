# Eye-Typing
FOR C++ :
Using OpenCV in C++ the code detects face and eyes using a haar cascade classifier. The coordinates of the midpoints of the eye are used to move the cursor on the screen. A keyboard interface is placed on the screen on which the cursor can move to select the desired letter. If the cursor is present on a letter for some seconds then the letter is printed on the screen.

FOR PYTHON :
Using Mediapipe, Opencv, Tkinter, Numpy and Pyautogui created a program that detects the movement of eyes and face to move the cursor on the screen using the relative face motion. A keyboard interface is placed on the screen on which the cursor can move to select the desired letter. If the cursor is present on a letter for some seconds then the letter is printed on the screen.


# Requirements
FOR C++ :
To run this code, OpenCV should be installed with Haar cascades files present in the current directory where the code is being executed. Downloading and using OpenCV in C++ could be challenging, I would recommend using Visual Studio and following a guide to make OpenCV work properly for C++. 

FOR PYTHON :
pip install mediapipe
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install pyautogui
pip install tk
