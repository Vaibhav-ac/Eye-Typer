# Eye-Typing
Using OpenCV in C++, the code caputures video from the camera and for each frame detects the face and eyes using haar cascades. The coordinates of the eyes are then used to move the cursor on the screen which is used for selecting the letters for typing. To exit the program press esc.

# Requirements
To run this code, OpenCV should be installed with Haar cascades files present in the current directory where the code is being executed. Downloading and using OpenCV in C++ could be challenging, I would recommend using Visual Studio and following a guide to make OpenCV work properly for C++.
